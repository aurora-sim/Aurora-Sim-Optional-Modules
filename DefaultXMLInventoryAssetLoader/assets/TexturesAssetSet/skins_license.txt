Includes makeup-less textures also! ^_^

This skin is released under a "BSD license"--which allows you to pretty much copy, mod, transfer as you wish... so you could legally make and sell your own modifications to them or even just "as-is" without any modifications. Really! No, I don't have a rabid team of lawyers waiting to DCMA-pounce you... 

You can download the skin PSDs from: http://eloheliot.blogspot.com/2007/12/my-psds-let-me-show-u-them.html
